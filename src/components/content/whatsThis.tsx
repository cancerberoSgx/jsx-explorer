    <h1>JSX Explorer</h1>

    <p>
      Allow to write JSX code (TypeScript or JavaScript) in an awesome editor, parse it and then show its structure in
      different ways:{' '}
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Elements Explorer</strong> shows the result of render the JSX expression returned by the code. The
        resulting HTML is represented as a tree of nodes (like JS.Element / <code>React.createElement()</code> internal
        structure) and also shows the result HTML or similar call.{' '}
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>JSX AST Explorer</strong> shows the abstract syntax tree of the code, letting get details of each node,
        and following the editor cursor position and viceversa.{' '}
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>JSX Colors</strong> let users explore a gallery of different JSX Syntax Highlight skins andalso create /
        edit its own. Differently than the other explorers, instead of representing JSX or its output as a tree of
        nodes, it tries to do so with a visual structure of "colored" code-parts. Is very flexible, exposes a lot of JSx
        kind of nodes and it's based on CSS selectors so hope you have fun and go crazy with it!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Initially this project was just a test to see how easy and viable was to build a real world react-like application
      using <a href="https://github.com/cancerberoSgx/jsx-alone">JSXAlone</a>. Now JSX-alone is only used in the backend
      (webworker) to render or parse JSX code but not in the front-end of this app.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>This application is not since it loads a bunch of libraries like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>TypeScript compiler</li>
      <li>ts-simple-ast</li>
      <li>monaco-editor</li>
      <li>react</li>
      <li>redux</li>
      <li>redux-sagas</li>
      <li>bulma.css</li>
    </ul>
